# üõ†Ô∏è Stake Pool Updater (SPU)

**Stake Pool Updater (SPU)** is a modular, interactive tool for upgrading your Cardano stake pool infrastructure.  
It streamlines the upgrade process as described in the [CoinCashew stake pool guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-ada/guide-how-to-build-a-haskell-stakepool-node/part-iv-administration/upgrading-a-node), including tasks such as:

- Managing CNCLI
- Checking required native libraries (e.g., libsodium, secp256k1, blst)
- Downloading and verifying updated config and genesis files
- Upgrading `cardano-node` (via prebuilt binaries or from source)

SPU is suitable for **block producers** and **relay nodes** alike.
