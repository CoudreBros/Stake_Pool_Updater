# üõ†Ô∏è Stake Pool Updater (SPU)

**Stake Pool Updater (SPU)** is a modular, interactive tool for upgrading your Cardano stake pool infrastructure.  
It streamlines the upgrade process as described in the [CoinCashew stake pool guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-ada/guide-how-to-build-a-haskell-stakepool-node/part-iv-administration/upgrading-a-node), including tasks such as:

- Managing CNCLI and gLiveView
- Checking required GHC/Cabal version & launch ghcup tui
- Checking required native libraries (e.g., libsodium, secp256k1, blst)
- Downloading and verifying updated config and genesis files
- Upgrading `cardano-node` (via prebuilt binaries or from source)

SPU is suitable for **block producers** and **relay nodes** alike.

## üì¶ Requirements

Before installing or running the Stake Pool Updater (SPU), ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- ‚úÖ Linux system (Debian-based recommended)
- ‚úÖ `git` (for cloning the repository)
- ‚úÖ `curl` (for running the installer via URL)
- ‚úÖ `python3` (version 3.8+ recommended)
- ‚úÖ `pip` (Python package manager)
- ‚úÖ `venv` module (for creating isolated Python environments)
- ‚úÖ `wget`, `tar` and other standard Unix tools
- ‚úÖ `ghcup` for checking required GHC/Cabal version

You can install missing dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl python3 python3-pip python3-venv wget tar vim
```

ghcup is required to manage GHC and Cabal versions before installing cardano-node and cardano-cli from source. You can install it by running:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```

## üöÄ Installation

The easiest way to install SPU is using the provided installer script:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoudreBros/Stake_Pool_Updater/main/SPU_Installer.sh | bash
```
By default, SPU will be installed to the $HOME/Stake_Pool_Updater directory.
You can change this path by modifying the CLONE_DIR variable at the beginning of the installer script.

Alternatively, you can manually clone the repository and run the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoudreBros/Stake_Pool_Updater.git
cd Stake_Pool_Updater
./SPU_installer.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

During installation, SPU_installer.sh will create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template. Adjust it according to your setup:

```bash
nano .env
```

Key configuration variables:

```ini
# Set to true if this node is a Block Producer; otherwise, set to false
IS_BLOCK_PRODUCER=false

# Where CNCLI will be installed
CNCLI_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin

# Where cardano-node binary will be installed
CARDANO_NODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin

# Where cardano-cli binary will be installed
CARDANO_CLI_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin

# Directory where Cardano source will be cloned and built
CARDANO_SOURCE_DIR=~/git/cardano-node-src

# Directory to store backups of cardano-node and cardano-cli
CARDANO_BACKUP_DIR=~/backups-cardano-binaries

# Path to your node configuration directory
NODE_CONFIG_PATH=~/cardano-my-node

# Name of the systemd service that runs your Cardano node
CARDANO_SERVICE_NAME=cardano-node
```

## üß∞ Usage

After instalation run stake_pool_updter.sh in terminal.

You will be presented with an interactive main menu offering all supported operations.

## üîê Safety Features

- SPU **never runs external scripts silently** ‚Äì all major steps require confirmation.
- Existing binaries and config files are **safely backed up** before changes.

## üßë‚Äçüíª For Developers

SPU is modular by design. Each task is implemented as a separate Python module, making the project easy to extend or customize.
